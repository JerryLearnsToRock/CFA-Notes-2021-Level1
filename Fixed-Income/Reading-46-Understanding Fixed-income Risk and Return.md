## Notes


### Risk on Fixed-Rate Bonds:
* Duration 定义
    * effective duration(curve duration): estimate the percentage change in price given a change in a benchmark yield curve
    * modified duration(yield duration): 
    * macaulay duration(yield duration): measured in terms of time periods
    * key rate duration

* yield duration: sensitivity of the bond price with respect to the bond's own yield-to-maturity(YTM).
    * Macaulay duration
    * modified duration 
    * money duration
    * the price value of a basis point(PVBP)

* curve duration: sensitivity of the bond price with respect to a benchmark yield curve.
    * effective duration

* 计算公式:
    * Macaulay: 算出N个折旧PV 然后用 当前的PV/总PV 算出一个weight，然后用weight * period = 当期的duration 相加和得到最后的duration
    * modified: MacDur / (1 + r)
* Convexity

#### Duration of a portfolio
* calculate the weighted average number of periods (not often used in practice)
* take a weighted average of the durations of the individual bonds in the portfolio (often used)
* portfolio duration = W1D1 + W2D2 + ... + WNDN
* money duration = annual modified duration * full price of bond position


### 课后练习
* capital = selling price - carrying value
* credit risk / interest risk 分别影响 本金 和 coupon收益
* 五个变量 已知四个 求最后一个  N I/Y PV PMT FV
    * Q4: 算
