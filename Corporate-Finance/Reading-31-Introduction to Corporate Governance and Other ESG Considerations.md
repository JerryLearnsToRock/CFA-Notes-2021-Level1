### 课后练习
* Q1: Corporate governance is the arrangement of checks, balances, and incentives a company needs to minimize and manage the conflicting interests between insiders and external shareholders.
* Q2: Amendments to bylaws 修改章程 election of directors is considered an ordinary resolution and, therefore, requires only a simple majority of votes to be passed.
* Q7: non-market factors in corporate governance: stakeholders can spread information quickly and shape public opinion
* 独立董事只能少量持股 1%以下 or 不是前十, 否则会影响独立性 independent board members have a “lead” director when the board chair is not independent. former employees 尽量不能作为独立董事 
* common law 能更好的保护股东利益
* Affiliated shareholders can protect a company against hostile takeover bids.
