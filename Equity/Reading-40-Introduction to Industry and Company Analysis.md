    * Industry Classification Benchmark


### Strategic Analysis of an Industry
* Porter's model
  * Rivalry among existing competitors
  * Threat of new entrants
  * Threat of new entrants 
  * Bargaining power of buyers
  * Bargaining power of suppliers
  
* Pricing power
  * barriers to entry: low barrier -> little pricing power, high barrier -> not necessarily mean high pricing power
  * industry concentration
  * industry capacity
  * market share stability
  * industry life cycle
    * Embryonic stage(the industry has just started): low growth, high price, large investment required
    * Growth stage: rapid growth, limited pressures, falling prices, increasing profitability
    * Shakeout(industry growth and profitability are slowing due to strong competition): growth has slowed, intense competition, increasing industry overcapacity, declining profitability
    * Mature: consolidation, high barriers, stable pricing, superior firms gain market share
    * Decline: Negative growth, declining price

### External Influences on Industry
* Macroeconomic factors: interest rates, availability of credit, inflation
* Technology
* Demographics: population growth, age distributions, geographical distribution

### 课后练习
* Q4: Russell Global Sectors 是three-tier classification, ICB(Industry Classification Benchmark) 和 GICS(Global Industry Classification Standard) 都是four-tier
* Q7: Commercial systems are generally updated more frequently than government systems, and include only publicly traded for-profit companies
* Q8: Business-cycle sensitivity falls on a continuum and is not a discrete “either–or” phenomenon
* Q14: business segment 是表示不同的产品线 BU比如苹果的iPhone是手机 Mac是电脑 iCloud是云服务 不同的segment可能会有不同peer group 手机有三星小米, Mac有联想、戴尔
* Q19: education 提高 -> skill 提高 -> wage 提高 -> consumer discretionary 非必需品增加
* Q23: life-cycle model y轴是Demand(需求量) x轴是Time(时间)
* Q25: concentrated industy: 集中度高的行业 members avoid competition on price
* Q27: 高准入门槛 + 高退出门槛 -> 低定价权
