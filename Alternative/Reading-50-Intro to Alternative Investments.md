  * more problematic and less available historical return and volatility data 历史数据不靠谱 因为波动太大
  * different legal issues and tax treatments 
  * correlation between alternative and traditional investments is low 相关性低

* Performance
  * Sharpe ratio 不适用 return容易被高估
  * negatively skewed return 不是normal return

## 课后练习


## 知识点题目
* real estate investment vehicle ??
* return earned on margin ?
* A measure to analyzing the performance of alternative investments that may exhibit negative skewness(什么意思?) in returns is Sortino ratio
* alternative + traditional -> high return + low risk 因为correlation比较低 风险小一些
* independently 计算management fee 和 incentive fee互相不影响 全部按照end of year value来算就行了
* PE management fees 的计算基数是 total committed capital minus capital returned from investments that are exited
* PE的流动性较差 钱投进去之后短期内没法退出了
* seed-stage 融资主要用来 product development and/or marketing efforts
* real estate 没办法homogeneity 因为每个房子都不一样
