## Ratio Analysis

### Activity Ratios
- Turnover: 一年中的周转次数 
    - 全是revenue作分子 / 分母是不同项

* Return => NI
* Profit => Gross profit / EBIT / EBT / NI
* Solvency => Debt
* Liquidity => Cash + marketable securities + A/R
* Turnover => Revenue 作为分子


### Liquidity Ratios (短期负债偿还能力)
- Current Ratio: 流动资产 / 
- Quick Ratio: (Cash + Short-term marketable securities + Receivables) / 
- Cash Ratio: Cash + Short-term marketable securities / Current Liabilities 
- Defensive Interval: (Cash + Short-term marketable securities + Receivables) / Daily cash expenditures
- Operating Cycle: 从拿到货的那一天开始算? 
- Cash conversion Cycle(Net Operating Cycle): Operating cycle - Number of days of payables
### Solvency Ratios(长期负债偿还能力)
- Debt-to-Equity Ratio
- Debt-to-Assets Ratio 
- Financial leverage
- Interest coverage 
- Fixed charge coverage: (EBIT + Lease payments) / (Interest + Lease payments) 怎么用? 
### Profitability Ratios(盈利能力)
* Gross profit margin = 
* Operating profit margin = EBIT / net revenue
* Pretax margin = EBT / net revenue
* Net profit margin = NI / net revenue


### Activity Ratios
Turnover = net revenue / assets


### DuPont Analysis
- Three-part Analysis 
- Five-part Analysis 

### Equity Analysis

- Valuation ratios 
    - Per-share ratios
    - Dividend-related ratios
    - Sustainable growth rate

### Credit Analysis 
Z-score < 1.81 -> Bankruptcy 

### Segment Reporting & Ratios 


**DSO(Days sales outstanding)**: accounts receivable / (annual sales / 365 days)


Financial leverage 是什么? 
ROE = Return on assets × Financial leverage


Turnover: 是次数的概念  表现efficiency 
365 / Turnover = 每一次的天数 

Average: (DSO 年末 + DSO 年初) / 2 =
