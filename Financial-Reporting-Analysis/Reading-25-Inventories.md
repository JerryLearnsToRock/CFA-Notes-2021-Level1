# Inventories


## Objective 
**Describe / Explain**
* different inventory valuation methods 
* Explain LIFO reserve and LIFO liquidation and their effcts on financial statements and ratios
* measurement of inventory at the lower of cost and net realisable value
* implications of valuing inventory at net realisable value for financial statements and ratios
**Calculate**
* calculate and compare cost of perpetual and periodic inventory systems
* calculate and explain how inflation and deflation of inventory costs affect 
* Convert a company's reported financial statements from LIFO to FIFO for purposes of comparison
* ratios of companies, use different inventory methods
**Compare/Distinguish**
* costs included in inventories and costs recognised as expenses 



## Notes

三种类型的存货:
* raw materials
* work in progress
* finished goods


inventory valuation method统一的话 可以方便对不同的公司进行比较
Inventory cost flow methods:
* specific identification: 每个unit按照那个unit的进价来计算
* weighted average cost: Between FIFO and LIFO value
* FIFO: 先卖出的按照先买入的进价计算
* LIFO (只有美国准则) : 先卖出的按照最后买入的进价计算 -> B/S 上的inventory反应的是older outdated costs


需要区分 costs that are included in inventory 和 costs that are recognized as expenses in the period 

LIFO method
LIFO reserve
effects of LIFO liquidations
adjustments LIFO FIFO


cost of goods sold(COGS) == cost of sales(COS) = beginning inventory + purchases - ending inventory 

product costs (
capitalized cost )= 

period costs(Not capitalized cost) 

LIFO reserve: amount that LIFO inventory is less than FIFO inventory

add LIFO reverse to LIFO inventory on the balance sheet. 
increase the retained earnings component of shareholders' equity by the LIFO reserve 

/ LIFO liquidation ??

LIFO liquidation 是干嘛的


## Inventory Recognition
- Expense 

## Inventory Valuation Methods
- Specific Identification 
- FIFO vs. LIFO
- Weighted Average Cost 

## Inventory Adjustments
- Inventory Write-downs

## Analysis on Inventory
- LIFO Reverse
- LIFO Liquidation 


## 课后练习
* Inventory liquidation 人为控制? 只卖货不进货 COGS 降低 Profit增加 Inventory下降 Asset下降  
* LIFO liquidation可以理解为卖的比进货多么？卖库存（根据课后第八题）
* LIFO reserve 究竟是怎么算出来的? 就直接通过LIFO FIFO计量方式不同直接算出来的 怎么用? Inventory的差值吗? 

* Q7 cost 是什么 存货的买入价还是卖出价?  
A: cost是当前的存货价格 一般来说因为通胀的存在 cost的成本都是一直在涨的 但是可以通过使用库存中的存货来降低当前period当中的存货成本 
In periods of rising inventory unit costs, the carrying amount of inventory under FIFO will always exceed the carrying amount of inventory under LIFO.  FIFO 是成本低的存货先被用掉了 剩下的是成本高的 库存的总价格比较高 LIFO reserve 不断增加
* Q8 unit costs are increasing from period-to-period
A: LIFO liquidation  是为了故意使用存货来压低成本
